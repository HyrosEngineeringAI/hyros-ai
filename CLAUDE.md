# AI HYROS — build rules for any LLM working in this repo

You are working on a **plug-and-play HYROS dashboard**: a snapshot of a
HYROS account (built from the HYROS MCP) rendered as tabs, where every tab
beyond the two core ones is a self-contained **feature folder**. People
fork this repo, add features, and export them to other forks. Keep it that
way.

## Read order
1. `FEATURES.md` — the feature contract (folder layout, manifest, `ctx`
   APIs, lifecycle, demo rules, spec format, pack/install). **Read before
   adding or changing any tab.**
2. `UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md` — tokens, type, components. Read before any visual
   change; never invent colors or fonts.
3. `README.md` — architecture (MCP → snapshot → KV → static page), setup
   flow, files.
4. `FINDINGS.md` — what the HYROS MCP can and cannot do (updated
   2026-09-15 against api-docs.hyros.com; when in doubt the official docs
   win: https://api-docs.hyros.com/llms.txt). Read before designing a live
   data feature; it tells you which questions are answerable with today's
   tools.
5. `public/features/scale/` and `public/features/health/` — worked examples
   of a live feature (server step + demo + view + spec);
   `public/features/funnel/` and `adltv/` — demo-only examples;
   `public/features/_template/` — the skeleton to copy.

## Hard rules
- **The browser never talks to HYROS.** Only `/api/refresh` (through a
  feature's `server.js`) calls the MCP. Views read `snapshot` only.
- **One snapshot, flat, per account.** A feature's data lives at
  `snapshot[<feature id>]`, produced by its `server.js` (live) and its
  `demo.js` (Demo account) in the SAME shape. Never write to other keys.
- **Derived metrics are re-derived after summing, never averaged.** Use
  `derive`/`aggregate` from `public/shared/metrics.js` for anything with a
  ratio (ROAS, CPL, CTR, …).
- **Money and numbers go through `ctx.fmt`.** It knows the Demo account
  hides cents.
- **Escape every string from data** with `ctx.esc` before putting it in
  HTML.
- **Features never import `app.js` or anything under `api/`.** They get
  everything through `ctx`. `scripts/feature-check.mjs` fails otherwise.
- **Never fail the refresh.** A server step catches its own errors and
  puts them inside its block (`{ error }`), checks `ctx.timeLeft()` before
  each MCP call, and stores `{ skipped: 'time budget' }` when out of time.
- **Demo is honest and deterministic.** `demo.js` uses the seeded `rng`
  from `public/demo.js`, never `Math.random`; the funnel never shows a
  >100% conversion; nothing real (no customer emails, no real revenue)
  ships in the repo — `data/seed.json` is generated from the demo.
- **No frameworks, no dependencies, no build step.** Vanilla ES modules
  served from `public/`; `api/` is plain Vercel functions with `fetch`.
- **No env vars for setup.** The first-run screen (password + HYROS key)
  is the only setup path; do not add required environment variables.
- **Every feature ships a `SPEC.md`** — that is how an idea travels to
  another fork even when the code does not.
- Do not put model identifiers (Claude, GPT, …) in commits, code or docs.

## Adding a feature (short version — details in FEATURES.md)
1. `cp -r public/features/_template public/features/<id>` and edit
   `feature.json` (id must equal the folder name).
2. Write `demo.js` first (the block shape), then `view.js`, then
   `server.js` if it is a live feature, then `SPEC.md`.
3. Add the id to `public/features/registry.js`.
4. `npm run check` (runs `scripts/feature-check.mjs`), then
   `node scripts/devserver.mjs` and look at the tab on the Demo account.
5. `node scripts/feature-pack.mjs <id>` to export a zip for other forks.

## Verify (after every change)
```
npm run check                          # metrics parity, store, FEATURE CONFORMANCE, pipeline + setup
node scripts/devserver.mjs             # http://127.0.0.1:4321  (password: dev)
DEV_SETUP_STATE=needs_setup node scripts/devserver.mjs   # first-run flow
node scripts/feature-pack.mjs --list   # registered features
```
There is no MCP in the sandbox; the pipeline test runs against
`scripts/mock-mcp.mjs`. A live feature is verified on a deployed preview by
hitting Refresh and reading the snapshot block.

## Layout
```
public/index.html, app.js, styles.css   core shell: sign-in, setup, accounts, report, CRM, drawer
public/shared/metrics.js                metric catalog + derive/aggregate/rollup (server + client)
public/shared/features.js               feature loader (browser + Node)
public/features/registry.js             which features are on, in tab order
public/features/<id>/                   one feature: feature.json view.js demo.js server.js style.css SPEC.md
public/demo.js                          the Demo account (core snapshot + shared demo helpers)
api/_snapshot.js                        core snapshot pipeline; calls api/_features.js for feature steps
api/_features.js                        runs every feature's server.js inside the refresh budget
api/_setup.js, _auth.js, _accounts.js   first-run config, password gate, multi-account registry
scripts/feature-check.mjs               feature conformance (in npm run check)
scripts/feature-pack.mjs                export / install feature zips
```

## GitHub access and deploys
This repo is private, under `HyrosEngineeringAI` on GitHub, and Vercel
deploys it: **a push to `main` is a production deploy**; any other branch
gets a deployed preview.

The user has no GitHub credentials for it and must never need any. Access
comes from a token issued by the HYROS MCP tool
`hyros_get_dashboard_repository_token` (your client may show it with a
prefix). A token works for this one repository only (clone, pull, push) and
expires one hour after it is issued.

Before any command that talks to GitHub (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`;
local ones such as `status`, `diff` or `commit` need nothing):
1. Get the repository name: `basename -s .git "$(git remote get-url origin)"`.
   Before the first clone, ask the user for it; it looks like
   `dash-<number>-<7 hex chars>`.
2. Call `hyros_get_dashboard_repository_token` with that name. Besides the
  token it returns `commitAuthorName` and `commitAuthorEmail`.
3. Set them as this repository's commit author (never `--global`):
   ```
   git config user.name "<commitAuthorName>"
   git config user.email "<commitAuthorEmail>"
   ```
4. Point `origin` at the token, then run the command:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:<token>@github.com/HyrosEngineeringAI/<repo>.git"
   git push origin <branch>
   ```
   First clone: `git clone "https://x-access-token:<token>@github.com/HyrosEngineeringAI/<repo>.git"`.

Rules:
- `Authentication failed`, `403` or `could not read Username` means the
 token expired: request a new one and retry once, never with the old one.
- Never ask the user for a GitHub username, password, token or SSH key, and
 never switch the remote to SSH.
- The token lives only in the `origin` URL inside `.git/config`. Never write
 it into a tracked file, a commit message, a script or an env file, and do
 not print it back unless the user asks.
- Before pushing to `main`, summarize the changes and confirm the user wants
 them in production. To check a change first, push a branch and use its
 preview.
- Tool not available: the HYROS MCP server is not connected. Ask the user to
 add `https://mcp.hyros.com/mcp` as an MCP server in their client and sign
 in with their HYROS account. Tool refused as not enabled ("Custom
 dashboards are not enabled for this account."): the feature is off for
 their account; they should contact HYROS support.
- Commits are authored as the dashboard owner returned by the tool, not as the user.
  Do not override the repository's `user.name` or `user.email`
